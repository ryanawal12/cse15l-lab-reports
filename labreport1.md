Step 1: INSTALLING VSCode

Above is a screenshot of the startup page of VSCode taken on my personal computer. Since I used VSCode in CSE 11, I had it pre downloaded and could skip theinstructions to download it. I just ran the application and the above is the screen that pops up soon after. From there, I clicked on Terminal --> New Terminal and that allowed me to move forward with my lab work for the day.
