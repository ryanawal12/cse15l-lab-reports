This is my Lab report for Week 1 CSE 15L lab session that happened on 04/06/2023

Step 1: Installing VSCode

Above is a screenshot of the startup page of VSCode taken on my personal computer. Since I used VSCode in CSE 11, I had it pre downloaded and could skip theinstructions to download it. I just ran the application and the above is the screen that pops up soon after. From there, I clicked on Terminal --> New Terminal and that allowed me to move forward with my lab work for the day.


Step 2: Remotely Connecting

Above shows the screenshot of the screen post successfully remotely connecting to the server. Since I was on a mac, I was able to skip the steps pertaining to downloading git for windows and installing git bash. I used the command $ ```ssh``` cs15lsp23hh@ieng6.ucsd.edu to ssh onto the server and entered my password. It then successfully connecting me onto my student account for this course, displaying useful information like latest failed logins (there were many that day while I was not completely sure of the process), the notice, cluser status and the CPU usage.

Step 3: Trying some Commands

Above are screenshots of the output when I used some of the commands that we learnt in class. 
1. ```pwd``` - prints the current directory
2. ```ls -lat``` - lists all the files in the current directory 
3. ```cd``` - changes my current directory to the home directory
4. ```..``` - takes us to the parent directory
5. ```cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt``` - concatenates or prints the contents of the hello.txt file stored at the path given.

By using some of these commands in combination, I have bolstered my knowledge of their working over the course of this lab.
