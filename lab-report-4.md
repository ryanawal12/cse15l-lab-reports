# **LAB REPORT 4 - Vim**

For this lab report, I will reproduce the tasks done in Lab 7, while summarizing each step and listing the keys pressed.

## **STEP 1 : LOGGING INTO ieng6 ACCOUNT**

### *Keys Pressed* 

``ssh<space>cs15lsp23hh@ieng6.ucsd.edu<return>``

### *Explanation*

As learnt in week 1, ``ssh`` is the command to log into my student account for this CSE 15L course. ``hh`` after ``cs15lsp23`` are my unique student specific letters. Due to the tasks in week 7, I had already generated an SSH key for my ``ieng6`` account, so the terminal does not prompt me for a password and I have successfully logged into my ``ieng6`` account using the ``ssh`` command.


## **STEP 2 : CLONING MY FORK OF THE REPOSITORY FROM MY GITHUB ACCOUNT**

### *Keys Pressed* 

``git<space>clone<space><command+v><return>``

### *Explanation*

I cloned the fork of the lab7 repository in my git account through ``git clone``. In my github account, I found the SSH fork URL and copied it to clipboard and pasted it in the terminal to be cloned using the command. 

## **STEP 3 : RUNNING THE TESTS, DEMONSTRATING THEY FAIL**
